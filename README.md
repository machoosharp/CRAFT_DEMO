# CRAFT_DEMO
 
 We are creating a simple demo of some advanced game mechanics, specifically to do with mesh slicing.

 The goal is to create a mechanic that mimics the effect of a blade cutting into a material, the most vital part of this being that the blade cannot slice through the material in one go, rather it cuts out chunks bit by bit until all the way through. This effect cannot be faked with shaders and must be done by slicing meshes as we intend to use the meshes later. good luck to us all...
